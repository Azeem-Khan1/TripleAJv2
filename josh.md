## Triple AJ IPO Project

We want to construct a calendar that can efficiently summarize and predict wether new initial public offerings in the market will be a good investment or not. We will also take Mergers and other market conditions into factor when evaluating an IPO. 

> As a frontend developer, my job is to construct the design below and create a functioning table with a good user interface. The table's objective is to lead the user to resourceful reports for each initial public offering. Our website will have a report for each upcoming IPO and also additional financial documents that help to evaluate IPOs (S-1 Filings, Balance Sheets, etc).

> The design shows a calendar which alerts the user for upcoming investment opportunities regarding new IPOs that might be a valuable asset in the future. Our job is to construct an efficient product that can deliver exceptional research which provides useful information to a potential investor. 

> As a frontend it is extremely important that the user interface is well crafted and accomplishes the job of being portrayed as an worthy investment tool.
