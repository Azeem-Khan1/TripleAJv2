## The Backend Process

![frontend design](/images/csplideo2.png)


We want to construct a calendar that can efficiently summarize and predict wether new initial public offerings in the market will be a good investment or not. We will also take mergers/acquisitions and other market conditions into account  when evaluating an IPO. 


> Introduction 1/5/2022 - As a backend developer, my job is to gather relevant financial data so that our hypothesis and algorithm regarding each IPO is more than somewhat accurate. As a backend plan and a team, we agreed to construct our website for 2022 IPOs first to see how our website would function with a full calendar. 

Some relevant financial documents that we can use: S-1 Filings, Form 10K, Form 10Q, Company Balance Sheet, Income Statement, etc. 

[Sample S-1 Filing for Google](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504073639/ds1.htm)

Below is an S-1 Filing for Google Inc, this document contains hundreds of pages of information that is used to valuate an IPO. We will use artificial intelligence to summarize financial documents so that it can extract broad and relevant information. We will use this extracted information to create a mini-report for investors to understand (this is mentioned in our rubric).

> Update 1/7/2022 - Here is a backend database for all 175 IPOs in 2022 for testing our website. Each IPO is summarized as a "Boom" or "Bust" regarding their market behavior. This database will be the backend for our first 2022 calendar. There are also graphs depicting trends for all of the IPOs in the past year.
