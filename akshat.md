## The Backend Process

We want to construct a calendar that can efficiently summarize and predict wether new initial public offerings in the market will be a good investment or not. We will also take Mergers and other market conditions into factor when evaluating an IPO. 

> As a frontend developer, my job is to construct the design below and create a functioning table with a good user interface. The table's objective is to lead the user to resourceful reports for each initial public offering. Our website will have a report for each upcoming IPO and also additional financial documents that help to evaluate IPOs (S-1 Filings, Balance Sheets, etc).
