# Our Idea

Our idea is to develop a website that monitors upcoming initial public offerings (IPOs). Inside our website, will be a frontend development of a calendar consisting of all upcoming IPOs and their respective financial information. The calendar will have 1-2 reports along with other financial documents, the reports will summarize if the IPO that is about to launch in the market will be a good investment or not. We will also add an API that will constantly update the stock price of the IPO. After 1 week of monitoring the initial public offering, the website will verify if it's prediction was correct. 

Potential investors can use this website as a research tool for new IPOs in the market.
